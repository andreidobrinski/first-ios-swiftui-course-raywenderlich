# Notes

SwiftUI

- released in 2019
- interfaces are created completely in code
- live preview of canvas
- can code yourself or with the canvas for assistance
- Apple prefers it as the method to build new apps

UIKit

- used before SwiftUI, release in 2008
- still a valid way to make apps

3 main reasons why devs still use UIKit today:

- SwiftUI only works on iOS 13 or later
- SwiftUI is early in development, not as mature. Missing features and rough edges
- UIKit exists as legacy code
